# kubernetes-demo
A few demos for Kubernetes. Run the prerequisites.bat beforehand just to cache images and such.

# To get started.
- Run prerequisites.bat
  It pulls the images used in the demos. Nice to have them locally before starting.  
  It also installs Helm (package manager) by first installing Chocolatey 

In addition:
- Download and install Visual Studio Code (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=852157)
- Download and install the latest version of Azure CLI (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

- In a cmd prompt run ``` code --install-extension <path-to-downloaded-azds> ```
